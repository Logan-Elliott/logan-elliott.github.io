Hello world! :wave:

My name is Logan Elliott.

I am a penetration tester with an insatiable curiosity. :black_cat:

I am always keen to see how I can build and break things. :wrench: :fire:

This blog is where I post about my work, research, learning experiences, and projects in information security and ethical hacking.

You will also find the occasional off-topic post about other tech projects I am currently working on or whatever I am enamored with at the moment, whether that be programming, hardware, or other.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on Twitter.

Thanks for visiting!
